Mod which adds a new playable character with cards based on different anime series.
I have tried to design each card in a way that resembles its character as much as possible,
e.g. Megumin that Exhausts after 1 use, or Darkness which likes to receive damage...

It also adds a new mechanic: **Synergies**, playing 2 cards of the same series in a row triggers additional effects. Cards with the **Shapeshifter** keyword can trigger any synergy.

The mod is still in progress, it currently contains 40 new cards and 1 starting relic. With time I will add new cards, relics potions and events...

Also, since I'm not an artist the actual character art is **The Defect**, if you would like to help me with that or with the card design feel free to add me on Steam, or simply contribute to this repo.
